This is all the different applications that can be used for the truck.

android - this directory contains the client application for android devices.  You can
install this app on your phone or any other android powered device and control the truck 

controllercode - this contains the code that runs on the arduino microcontroller that is 
mounted in the truck.

java - This is the remote control client written in java

perl - There are several scripts in this directory.  
	server.pl - this is the actual server.  This needs to be running on a 
			pandaboard/beagleboard, laptop, netbook, or any other linux powered device.
			The arduino needs to be plugged into this device.  So, whatever device you choose
			to mount in the vehicle, it has to have a usb port.
	client.pl - this is the remote control client written in perl.  It uses the SDL library.
	server_debug.pl - this is just a debugging script.  If the arduino isn't plugged in, you can 
			run this script to test out the controls from any of the clients and you can 
			test out the network connections from the clients
	gps.pl - this is a program that reads gps coordinates from a gps module.  This script
			isn't related to the server code or any of the clients for the truck.

python - client.py, this is the client written in python.  However, this client is old and hasn't
	been re-written for the new server.pl application.  

qt - These are the client programs written in qt.  there are two directories in here, one for each application.  Each application has its own
	purpose
	remotecontrol - this is the main client application
