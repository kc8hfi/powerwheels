There are a few directories here

arduino-0021 - this contains the arduino IDE.  If you have the ide already, you don't really 
	need this.

documentation - this program was a senior project.  The documentation for the source code isn't
	up to date in the files in this folder.  

source - this is where all the functionality lives. Theres a README file in this directory 
	that describes the server and all the different clients.  

All the code under the source directory is under the GPLv3.  The license is in all the various 
	sub-directories under the source directory.  You can get a copy of the license from
	http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
